@Test : Mark a meyhod as a Test Case. It creates and let us run the cases.

@Ignore : Skips a test case

Assertions :
-Hard Assertion  : Stops the test execution if the Assertion line fails

-Soft Assertion : Continues to the test execution even if the Assertion line fails. To use soft assertion we have to create softAssert object
   SoftAssert sa = new SoftAssert();
sa.assertTrue()......... or other assertions you can use
sa.assertAll() must a used at to mark the assertion as passed or failed.
If i don't use this, then the report will always shows as PASS.
