What do your remember from the last class ?
-Page Object Model ?
What is POM ?
    -It is a framework design pattern
    -We separate page object and action test cases.
    -We store page object in a different class and we use them in  test classes
    -We use @FindBy annotation to locate the page object in page class
    -PaceFactory : It is used in constructor in the pages to instantiate the objects
Why POM ?
    -Reusability
    -Easy maintenance
    -Readability
    -Time saver
